--------------------------------------------------------------------

start

The city of Troy has been seized, the war won. Ten years away from home are finally coming to
an end. You're on your way to Ithaca now, hundreds of sea miles both behind and ahead of you.
The problem's not the distance, you know very well, but the dangers that lie in between
- you'll have to act smart to get back to your homeland.

You think of your wife. You think of your little boy, who's probably not so little anymore.

Failure is not an option.

With trusted crew by your side, the six hundred men under your command, there just might be
hope for you after all.

You should look around, talk to them while it's not busy or sail to cross the sea and reach home.

|: sail west
There's solid land nearby - you notice the glowing light of a fire. It seems inviting.
|: sail north
You're not far from an island, rugged shoreline making way to green fields and rocky mountains
full of caves. One cave in particular looks easy to reach.
|: disembark
At the entrance of a cave, you find a herd of sheep - food much tastier than anything you
have left from your supplies. Some of your men stay behind, while the rest of you ventures
onward to search the tunnels.
You walk a long while, far into the cave, when a deep voice echoes through the darkness.
'Who are you? What are you doing, breaking into the house of Polyphemus?'
Single, massive eye opens behind you, glowing in the light of your torch. Polyphemus
does not look happy as he waits for an answer. 'What's your name, stranger?'
|: nobody
'Are you the one who killed my sheep, nobody? My favourite sheep. You will pay for what you did
with your own blood.'
The fight is long and grueling, with much death on your side. Pools of fresh blood form on the cave's floor.
You have 556 crew members remaining.
But no one comes to his aid.
It's your opportunity to leave the cave, embark on a ship and get the hell away.
|: embark

You manage to embark on a ship and leave the Cyclops' cave behind.
As you do, you can't shake the feeling of being watched, but the eyes are not only those of your men nor the foe
you've escaped from. The gods have taken an interest in your actions. Something in the air has changed.
You end up back at the same open sea, but maybe you should look around more.
|: disembark
Disembarking!
|: look
The home of the wind god, Aeolus, is just as unique as its owner might suggest. Loud and playful
with various puffs of clouds twisting and turning in the air, as if alive.
Aeolus himself flies around as well, never in one place for long. You feel his gaze following you.
|: talk aeolus
You kneel down and describe your situation, knowing that the god can hear.
Your ask for assistance is first met with disheartening nothing, but then - laughter.

Aeolus comes to a stop right before you. 'I suppose we could play a game, Odysseus of Ithaca.'
I'll show you a bag with the winds of the storm all trapped. If it gets opened, whatever
the reason... well, good luck.'
'Do be careful who you trust, captain, you never really know.'

And with that, he's gone on a breeze again, leaving a tied wind-bag at your feet.
|: take wind-bag
You pick up the wind-bag.
|: embark
Calm open sea and the island of a god, nothing more for you here. You instinctively look
towards north, where the sky's a clear expanse of blue.
|: sail north
The sky is clear, the water smooth - no storm, no tidal wave. You see Ithaca - your destination, your
kingdom, your home - on the horizon. You can already feel the ghost of your wife's embrace.

|: sail north

With the storm contained, it shouldn't take much longer to reach the coast. Mere weeks.

You wish you could relax now, but the wind gods' words won't let you. 'Be careful who you
trust, captain' pushes you to keep your eyes open at all times.

You guard the wind-bag to the best of your abilities, but the need to sleep proves stronger eventually.

The dream is a lovely one - the family reunited, Penelope and Telemachus in your arms.

The reality is not. The bag lies open. The raging storm tears at your ships with vengeance, vicious
currents leading you to distant shores far, far away from Ithaca.
|: look
The waters here feel thick with enchantment, and Circe's island lies ominously ahead.
|: disembark
Disembarking!
|: look
After disembarking on Circe's island, you step into a lush, enchanted forest.
The air is thick with mystery, and your instincts warn you of hidden dangers.
To continue, you can talk to Hermes or confront Circe to face her enchantments.
|: talk hermes
Hermes, appearing like a ghostly figure, approaches with wisdom and a gift.
Hermes offers you a magical herb, saying it will protect you from Circe's spells. You may need it if you choose to confront her.
You now have a magical herb in your possession.
|: confront circe
Holding the magical herb, you feel its protective aura as you step into Circe's palace.
You sense her spells failing against you.
You now have a choice: will you 'spare' her life or 'kill' her?
spare
You decide to spare Circe, who restores your crew to human form. They are relieved, and gratitude fills the air.
Time passes; a full year slips by as Circe becomes your ally and lover. The comforts of the island nearly make you forget your quest.
One day, your crew approaches, urging you to remember Ithaca.
You can now TALK TO CREW to discuss the journey ahead.
|: talk crew
Your crew gathers, their expressions serious. 'Captain,' they say, 'it’s time we resume our journey to Ithaca.'
They remind you of the goal that has driven you across the seas, and their loyalty fills you with resolve.
You can now TALK TO CIRCE to seek further guidance from her.
|: talk circe
Circe nods in understanding, sensing your readiness to continue your journey.
'If you wish to return to Ithaca,' she says, 'you must first venture west, to the Underworld, then directly come back to me.'
But heed my warning — avoid the north, for giants dwell there, and their strength is unmatched.
Circe hands you an empty bottle, saying it may prove useful later in your journey.
With her guidance, you feel prepared to set sail once more.
|: embark
The waters here feel thick with enchantment, and Circe's island lies ominously ahead.
|: sail west
You have reached the mysterious and eerie waters of the Underworld.
|: disembark
Disembarking!
|: look
You sense an opportunity to talk to Charon, the ferryman who will guide you across the River Styx.
|: talk charon
Charon, the ferryman, explains the rules of the River Styx.
He says he will help you cross, but only if you solve the puzzle.
He can only take one thing at a time: the crew, the wine, or Cerberus, the three-headed dog.
However, if the crew is left with the wine or Cerberus, disaster will strike.
You must cross the river in a specific order to avoid tragedy.
To start, Charon will take the crew across.
start_ferry_puzzle
You can either take the wine or Cerberus next.
The following commands are available to you:
1. 'ferry X' - to have Charon take X across the river.
2. 'return X' - to have Charon return with X.
X can be 'crew', 'wine', 'cerber', or 'none'.
Please make sure to follow the correct order to avoid losing crew members.
|: start_ferry_puzzle
The ferry puzzle has begun! Type 'ferry <item>' or 'return <item>' to proceed.
|: ferry crew

End side: [Crew,Charon,Cerber,Wine]
Congratulations! You have successfully ferried everything across the River Styx. You can now talk to Tiresias
|: talk tiresias
Tiresias, the prophet, speaks to you with grave solemnity:
I see your future, Odysseus. You may reach Ithaca, but the path will be fraught with hardships.
The island of Helios and its sacred cattle will be your doom if you dare approach them.
The fates have already sealed the tragic death of your mother, which you have yet to learn.
The ferryman urges you to hurry, though he offers you the chance to talk to one of three shades: your mother, Achilles, or Agamemnon.
But choose wisely, for you can only speak with one of them.
|: talk achilles
Achilles, the great warrior, speaks to you with fiery intensity:
'Odysseus, your journey is long, and I know the struggles you face. The gods play cruel games with you.
But you must know, I feel no peace here in the Underworld. The thought of my death haunts me still.'
Achilles decides to speak to Charon to extend your stay. You now have time to speak to both your mother and Agamemnon for any wisdom they can provide.
|: talk mother
A spectral figure appears before you—your mother, Anticleia.
'My dear son, I died of grief and longing for you.'
The days of our separation broke my heart. I wish I could have seen you return to Ithaca.
With a soft sigh, she hands you a charm—a Charybdis Lure, a precious item that may one day save you from the whirlpool.
|: talk agamemnon
Agamemnon, the great king of Mycenae, speaks to you from the shadows:
'I was betrayed by my wife, Clytemnestra, and murdered upon my return to Mycenae. But you, Odysseus, will fare better, I hope.'
He offers you a map of the seas ahead—knowledge of the islands that await you in Act II.
Type 'show_map' to look at it.
Now you must return to your ship. Further conversations are no longer possible.
|: sail east
The waters here feel thick with enchantment, and Circe's island lies ominously ahead.
|: disembark
Disembarking!
|: look
You step back onto Circe's island, feeling the weight of your journey to the Underworld lingering upon you.
The familiar sights of her enchanted island are a strange comfort after the shadows of Hades.
Circe greets you with a knowing look, sensing the trials you’ve endured and the wisdom you have gained.
It’s clear she has more guidance to offer, should you seek her counsel.
You may now talk to Circe to ask for further instructions on your journey.
|: talk circe
Circe sees the weight of your journey and speaks again with wisdom:
'Your next trial, Odysseus, is the Sirens' Sea, where their hypnotic singing lures sailors to destruction.
You must have your crew plug their ears with beeswax to resist the sound. But you—remain unsealed and tied to the mast to hear their song.'

'After passing the Sirens, you will face Scylla and Charybdis. I advise you to sail closer to Scylla; though she will claim 6% of your crew, Charybdis devours entire ships.'

Decide now how many of your crew will assist me in gathering ingredients for a potion that could protect you against Scylla.
This potion will be crucial if you choose to pass near Scylla, as it may shield you from becoming one of the 6% she devours.
Each crew member represents a 1% chance of survival. The rest will collect beeswax to seal their ears.
Your crew now consists of 556 brave warriors.
Please enter the number of crew for the potion:
100
Circe confirms your plan:
100 crew members will work on the potion, granting you a 100% chance of survival.
506 crew members are protected.
Those unprotected by wax will perish under the Sirens' spell.
When ready, you may depart towards the Sirens' Sea.
|: embark
The waters here feel thick with enchantment, and Circe's island lies ominously ahead.
|: sail east
The waters are calm but ominous as you approach the domain of the Sirens.
In the distance, their figures are barely visible, their songs ready to ensnare anyone who listens.
You must now decide whether to block your own ears or not.
Type plug_ears if you want to block your ears or leave_ears_open if you want to hear the Sirens' song.
You must now decide whether to block your own ears or not.
Type 'plug_ears' if you want to block your ears or 'leave_ears_open' if you want to hear the Sirens' song
leave_ears_open
You choose to leave your ears open. Your crew ties you tightly to the mast, as per Circe's advice.
The Sirens' voices fill the air, haunting and beautiful.
You listen, enthralled, and in their song, you learn of a mystical potion recipe that grants strength and protects life.
You have learned the potion recipe!
Not all of your crew were protected, and 50 of them succumbed to the Sirens' song.
With the Sirens behind you, you should sail south on towards the looming cliffs of Scylla and Charybdis.
You brace yourself for another challenge as the journey continues.
: sail south
The sea grows treacherous as you approach the domain of Scylla and Charybdis.
To your left, you see Scylla's ominous cliffs, while Charybdis churns the water violently to your right.
You must choose which path to take to continue.
Type sail_scylla to navigate past Scylla or sail_charybdis to risk waters near Charybdis.
|: sail_charybdis
You use the mysterious Charybdis Lure, guiding your ship safely past the deadly whirlpool.
The waters calm, and you find yourselves out of danger.
After surviving the perilous pass, a fierce storm catches you off guard.
The raging waves drive your ship eastward, and you find yourselves on the shores of the Island of the Sun God.
|: look
A violent storm catches your ship, forcing you to seek refuge on a nearby island.
This is the sacred island of the Sun God, Helios, where his holy cattle roam.
|: disembark
Disembarking!
|: look
You disembark onto the island, hoping the storm will soon pass.
Unfortunately, the storm shows no sign of stopping, and you will need to stay here longer.
Your food supplies are exhausted, and the crew is looking to you for guidance.
You had better talk to them for advice.
|: talk crew
Your crew gathers around, their faces pale with hunger.
One of them speaks up: 'Captain, we cannot last without food. These cattle are our only chance.'
You remember Tiresias's warning not to eat the sacred cattle of Helios.
Make your choice:
Type "eat_cattle" to let the crew feast and risk the wrath of the gods.
Type "do_not_eat_cattle" to let your crew starve.
|: do_not_eat_cattle
You stand firm in your decision: 'We will not eat the cattle of the Sun God.'
The crew protests but ultimately obeys. Over the next days, hunger claims the lives of 50 members.
|: eat_cattle
Reluctantly, you allow the crew to slaughter the sacred cattle of Helios.
The feast restores their strength, but you sense a dark omen in the air.
As you consume the cattle, you find a special vial containing the blood of Helios’s sacred beast.
This is the final ingredient needed to complete the elixir of strength.
Type "complete_elixir" to obtain it.
|: complete_elixir
Using the empty bottle and the blood of Helios’s cattle, you complete the Elixir of Strength. You are now ready to continue journey
|: continue_journey
As you leave the island, a thunderous voice echoes: 'For your desecration, you shall be punished!'
The sea rages as a powerful storm descends upon your ship.
Thanks to the Elixir of Strength, you alone withstand the gods' wrath and survive.
Your crew perishes, and you lose consciousness...
|: look
You stand on the shores of an island. It is breathtaking but empty, nobody is to be seen.
The only sound is wind blowing through the trees. You are exhausted from all your travels and collapse on the ground.
Your crew is no loger alive, your ship is gone. You are left all alone.
When you wake up, the first thing you see is a woman, a goddess, who introduces herself as Calypso.
She is beautiful, but you want to return home. You can try asking her how to leave.
|: talk calypso
Calypso gazes at you and says: 'Why hurry to leave? This island is paradise, and I will care for you here forever.'
To return to the life you truly seek, you must craft a raft that can withstand Poseidon's storms.
Gather the resources of the island: wood, logs, rope, and cloth. Only then will you be able to return home.
|: gather wood
You have gathered 1 wood(s) already.
|: gather wood
You have gathered 2 wood(s) already.
|: gather rope
You have gathered 1 rope(s) already.
|: gather rope
You have gathered 2 rope(s) already.
|: gather logs
You have gathered 1 logs(s) already.
|: gather logs
You have gathered 2 logs(s) already.
|: gather cloth
You have gathered 1 cloth(s) already.
|: gather cloth
You have gathered all necessary materials for the raft! You can start building it.
|: build logs
You lay the base from logs as the foundation of your raft.
|: build wood
You have to build something else.
|: build rope
You tie everything together with rope to stabilize the structure.
|: build wood
You arrange the wood into a stable frame on top of the base.
|: build cloth
You set up the mast. The raft is complete! You can now attempt to escape Calypso's Island.
|: escape
With your raft complete, you set out to sea, leaving Calypso's Island behind.
At last, you set foot on Ithaca, your homeland.
After all the trials, you've made it home, where every person on the street talks about
the queen's challenge.

But that's a story for another day.
After years lost at sea, battles fought, and gods defied, you've finally reached Ithaca.
You've proven that courage and loyalty can overcome even the wrath of gods.

Welcome home, Odysseus.
