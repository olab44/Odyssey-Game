> start
The city of Troy has been seized, the war won. Ten years away from home are finally coming to
an end. You're on your way to Ithaca now, hundreds of sea miles both behind and ahead of you.
The problem's not the distance, you know very well, but the dangers that lie in between
- you'll have to act smart to get back to your homeland.
You think of your wife. You think of your little boy, who's probably not so little anymore.
Failure is not an option.
With trusted crew by your side, the six hundred men under your command, there just might be
hope for you after all.
You should look around, talk to them while it's not busy or sail to cross the sea and reach home.
> look
Open sea stretches in all directions, no land in sight.
> sail north
Your way is blocked by giant waves and giant storms.
You should probably turn back south towards calmer waters -
but Ithaca has never been closer in the last ten years, and the way home is through.
> sail north
It turns out you cannot beat the force of nature that easily. You lose ships - the screams of over
na hundred men are drowned out by the storm as they disappear below the waves.
You cannot control your course as the currents are too strong. You should look around to see where you have ended up.

> count crew
You have 300 men remaining.

You cannot control your course as the currents are too strong. You should look around to see where you have ended up.
There is solid land nearby - you notice the glowing light of a fire. It seems inviting.
> disembark
The island is calm and serene, the whole atmosphere making you sleepy. You see a lake
that is surrounded by plain houses. The people milling around pay you no mind at all,
their thoughts far away.
There is plenty of food on their tables - strange, glowing fruits, which you recognize as
mind-numbing lotus. There is also an abundance of wine - surely the lotus-eaters would not
be mad, were you to take a jug for yourself.
> take wine
You have taken wine
> embark
There is solid land nearby - you notice the glowing light of a fire. It seems inviting.
> sail north
You are not far from an island, rugged shoreline making way to green fields and rocky mountains
full of caves. One cave in particular looks easy to reach.
> count crew
You have 150 men remaining.
> disembark
You walk a long while, far into the cave, when a deep voice echoes through the darkness.
Who are you? What are you doing, breaking into the house of Polyphemus?
A single, massive eye opens behind you, glowing in the light of your torch. Polyphemus does not look happy as he waits for an answer.
What is your name, stranger?
nobody
At the last second, you grab the flask of wine taken from the island of lotus-eaters and aim for the cyclops' still open mouth.
The wine from lotus flowers makes his thoughts and movements sluggish. He manages to land only a few blows.
But no one comes to his aid. It is your opportunity to leave the cave, embark on a ship and get the hell away.
You sense that something in the air has changed, you should scan the see once more
> embark
You are not far from an island, rugged shoreline making way to green fields and rocky mountains
full of caves. One cave in particular looks easy to reach.
> sail east
Your way is blocked by giant waves and giant storms.
You should probably turn back south towards calmer waters -
but Ithaca has never been closer in the last ten years, and the way home is through.
> sail east
The storm is your final fight, the only thing still blocking your way home - and so you are ready
to risk it all, look for the way through even when there seems to be none.
You try your best...
It is just not enough.
Your ship is the last one from the fleet to fall victim to the crashing waves.
